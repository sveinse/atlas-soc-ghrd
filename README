Atlas-SoC / DE0-Nano-SoC Hardware Design and Preloader
======================================================

This repo contains the build scripts to be able to build the FPGA
Hardware design and (Linux) preloader of the Atlas-SoC / DE0-Nano-SoC
evaluation kit

The Atlas-SoC and the DE0-Nano-SoC refers to the same physical kit, but sold
under two different options/markeds. The DE0-Nano-SoC is targeting hardware
designers, while the Atlas-SoC is targeting the software/linux aspect.
